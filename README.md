Socratic Questioning App
     The Socratic Questioning App is a web-based application designed to help individuals challenge their thoughts and emotions in moments of anxiety, anger, or 
     uncertainty. The app guides users through a series of questions based on the principles of Socratic questioning, a method of critical thinking and self- 
     reflection.
How it Works
     Upon launching the app, users are presented with a welcome message and a brief introduction to the concept of Socratic questioning.
     Users can then choose to start the questioning process, which presents them with a series of thought-provoking questions designed to challenge their 
     assumptions and encourage critical thinking.
		 
Each question is accompanied by an emoji to help set the tone and facilitate a more engaging experience

Users can respond to each question in a text area, and their responses are saved for later review.

The app allows users to navigate through the questions at their own pace, with options to submit their responses, proceed to the next question, or exit the app.

Upon completing the questioning process, users can review their responses and reflect on their thoughts and emotions.
